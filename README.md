# Password_Generator

## Description
In this project, I created a random password generator. HTML, CSS and some JavaScript were provided to me, but I authored all the code that generates and displays the user's password. I first use alert, confirm, and prompt popup boxes to obtain the user's password parameters, I then randomly select eligible characters to satisfy the desired length, and lastly I utilize the Document Object Model to display the user's password to the page.

This project is an introduction to using JavaScript to communicate with a user to reach a desired output. The implemenation of popup boxes here in lieu of forms is a bit primitive, but the end result is still the same.
