# Password_Generator

 ## Description
 In this project, I created a random password generator. HTML, CSS and some JavaScript code were provided to me, but I authored all the code that randomly generates and displays the user's password. I used alert, confirm, and prompt popup boxes to communicate with the user to obtain the parameters for their password.
